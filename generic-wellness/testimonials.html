            <p>“I'd always wanted to eat healthier, but never really had a good idea of what that would look like for me. After going over my favorite foods, Jane was able to give me a framework for a week's worth of meals, and after the first 3 days I already had so much more energy. Now I can actually enjoy going on walks in the evening with my spouse!”<br>-Sally Mae</p>

            <p>“I had a dunk contest coming up, but I hadn't really prepared as much as a should have, after a little over a month of Dan's workout schedule, I went from dunking with one hand with a running start, to only needing a few steps to dunk two handed, I had a ton of fun and even managed to take top 3 in the dunk contest!”<br>-Richard Williams</p>

            <p>“I've been running off and on for the past few years. I'd always wanted to run a marathon, but getting past the half marathon always just seemed daunting. I could run a 10k no problem but more than doubling that was proving to be too much. After meeting with a personal trainer and nutrition specialist at Generic Wellness I was able to get to the half marathon in under two months, next stop, marathon!”<br>-Tim Speedboat</p>
