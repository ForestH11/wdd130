      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Are you doing the basics of taking care of yourself like maintaining a good diet and exercise, 
          but still feel like your quality of life isn't what you want it to be? If your doctor has signed 
          off on your health and encouraged you to maintain your diet and exercise, but you feel like you 
          aren't getting the results you want, that's where we come in. We can help you formulate a plan for 
          how to eat, what exercises to do, and how you can structure your week to get over that hump and 
          start feeling more like you want to. Generic Wellness helps everyone from teenagers to seniors 
          live a more healthy and happy life.

        Each of us have differing likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses, and varying levels of fitness for the activities we perform on a regular basis. Here at Generic Wellness, we want to help you do what you love without having to hold back because you aren't as healthy or fit as you would like to be. From nutrition to exercise, to physical limitations, we can help you do what you love better. For some that may mean a greater level of proficiency, for others it can be as simple as feeling better while going about your day to day. Whatever the case, we are here to help you jump that extra inch, feel better about yourself as you share your artwork, or even get to touching your toes!

        Testimonials:
“I'd always wanted to eat healthier, but never really had a good idea of what that would look like for me. After going over my favorite foods, Jane was able to give me a framework for a week's worth of meals, and after the first 3 days I already had so much more energy. Now I can actually enjoy going on walks in the evening with my spouse!”

“I had a dunk contest coming up, but I hadn't really prepared as much as a should have, after a little over a month of Dan's workout schedule, I went from dunking with one hand with a running start, to only needing a few steps to dunk two handed, I had a ton of fun and even managed to take top 3 in the dunk contest!”

“I've been running off and on for the past few years. I'd always wanted to run a marathon, but getting past the half marathon always just seemed daunting. I could run a 10k no problem but more than doubling that was proving to be too much. After meeting with a personal trainer and nutrition specialist at Generic Wellness I was able to get to the half marathon in under two months, next stop, marathon!”

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>   
        The home wireframe has the highest fidelity, the Testimonials and Services pages have low fidelity header and footers
